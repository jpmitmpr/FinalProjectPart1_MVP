# FinalProjectPart1_MVP

## What This Project Is About
This is a simple RESTful API I built for my college project. It’s made with **Node.js**, **Express**, **Sequelize**, and **SQLite**.  
The API handles three main types of data: **Users**, **Posts**, and **Comments**, and lets you do all the standard CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).  
It also has basic logging and error handling to keep things organized and easy to debug.

## How to Get It Running

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd FinalProjectPart1_MVP
